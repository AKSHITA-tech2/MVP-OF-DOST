This is my first project and i named it as Dost
DOST AI is a foundational prototype of an AI-powered educational assistant designed to help students from Grades 1 to 5 with subjects like Science, Social Science, and General Knowledge. The MVP showcases a basic but functional version of the system.

 Current Capabilities (MVP):
📂 CSV-Based Knowledge Base: The system is currently trained on user-uploaded CSV files containing structured curriculum-based data.

💬 Custom Q&A: After uploading the dataset, users can ask natural language questions and receive context-aware answers directly from the trained content.

🎯 Curriculum Focused: Designed specifically to assist younger students with relevant and age-appropriate content.

🚀 Future Vision
This MVP lays the groundwork for more advanced capabilities. In future versions, DOST AI will include:

🤖 ChatGPT Integration: Seamlessly connect to large language models like GPT to handle broader and more complex queries.

📚 Multi-Modal Support: Go beyond CSV files to support PDFs, textbooks, and visual inputs.

🗣️ Conversational Interface: Turn DOST into a fully interactive AI chatbot tailored for education.

☁️ Cloud Deployment: Enable real-time access for schools, teachers, and students on web or mobile platforms.

I will show you a sneak peak of how it looks like!!
